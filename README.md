Hamming code is a special code in a Computer network, which is a set of error-correction codes. 
In Computer Graphics, it is mainly used for detecting and correcting errors that occur at the time of data transmission from sender to receiver. 
In Java, we can implement the code to detect and correct errors using Hamming code.

The code is known as Hamming code because it was developed by R.W. Hamming to detect and correct errors.
