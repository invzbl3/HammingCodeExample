Create HammingCodeExample class to implement the Hamming Code functionality in Java

Hamming code is a special code in a Computer network, which is a set of error-correction codes. 
In Computer Graphics, it is mainly used for detecting and correcting errors that occur at the time of data transmission from sender to receiver. 
In Java, we can implement the code to detect and correct errors using Hamming code.

The code is known as Hamming code because it was developed by R.W. Hamming to detect and correct errors.

Implement a multi-threaded Hamming number generation algorithm. Hamming numbers 
are numbers which follow 2^k*3^m*5^n, where k, m and n are non-negative integers. Example: 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 36... While these numbers are 
quite common in the range from 1 to 60, their appearance becomes sparser the longer the 
series becomes.

Use following basic design for your implementation. Don't be surprised by the "mult_by_n" 
(i.e., multiplication instead of exponentiation) some deviations from the mathematical formula 
were necessary to achieve the desired learning goal:
